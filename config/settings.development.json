Pat the flour down on the chops for a bit to make sure plenty of flour sticks to the chops.\n Let chops sit on a rack for 5 minutes to harden a bit and develop a nice crust.\n Add enough oil to a large cast iron skillet that the oil will come half-way up the chops. This will probably be about a quart. Heat the skillet on medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add two chops and fry for about 5 minutes per side until the crust is golden brown. The chop might be slightly pink on the inside, but should be cooked through (juices should run clear). If this worries you, cook it for 6 minutes per side. It's never a bad idea to cut into one to test the doneness also.\n Remove chops to a rack or paper towel to drain. Fry other two chops.\n When chops are done, carefully pour out all the oil in the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons. The oil will be hot obviously so don't pour it into anything that would melt. An empty coffee can is always good.\n Add 1/4 Cup flour to cast iron skillet and whisk over medium heat. The flour should combine with the oil to make a roux. Make sure to scrape up any bits of flour stuck to the pan. The roux should be a thick paste. If it's not sticking together, you need more oil, so add another tablespoon. If it's really runny, you need more flour. Cook roux until it starts to brown slightly, about 2 minutes.\n Slowly whisk in milk. Whisk constantly. Whisk out any lumps that form and continue to whisk until gravy thickens. About 3 cups of milk will probably give you a really good gravy, but you might need more or less depending on your roux. Whisk in a pinch of salt and pepper to season roux.\nServe pork chops slathered in gravy!",

      "instructions": "1. Place the chiles in a straight-sided large skillet over medium-low heat and gently toast the chiles until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Don't let them burn or they'll turn bitter. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover them with very hot water and soak until soft, 15 to 45 minutes, turning once or twice.\n2. Drain the chiles; split them and remove stems and seeds (a brief rinse helps remove seeds, but don't wash away the flesh). Place the chiles in the bowl of a blender and add the cumin, black pepper, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/4 cup water. Purée the mixture, adding more water as needed (and occasionally scraping down the sides of the blender jar), until a smooth, slightly fluid paste forms (you want to eliminate all but the tiniest bits of skin.) Set the chile paste aside.\n3. Return skillet to medium-high heat and melt 2 tablespoons of the lard. When it begins to smoke, swirl skillet to coat and add half of the beef. Lightly brown on at least two sides, about 3 minutes per side, reducing the heat if the meat threatens to burn. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with 2 more tablespoons of lard and the remaining beef. Reserve.\n4. Let the skillet cool slightly, and place it over medium-low heat. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of lard in the skillet; add the onion and garlic and cook gently for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the stock, the remaining 2 cups water and gradually whisk in the masa harina to avoid lumps. Stir in the reserved chile paste, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a spatula to loosen any browned bits. Add the reserved beef (and any juices in the bowl) and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain the barest possible simmer (just a few bubbles breaking the surface) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender but still somewhat firm and 1 1/2 to 2 cups of thickened but still liquid sauce surrounds the cubes of meat, about 2 hours.\n5. Stir in the brown sugar and vinegar thoroughly and add more salt to taste; gently simmer 10 minutes more. At this point, it may look like there is excess sauce. Turn off the heat and let the chili stand for at least 30 minutes, during which time the meat will absorb about half of the remaining sauce in the skillet, leaving the meat bathed in a thick, somewhat fluid sauce. Stir in additional broth or water if the mixture seems too dry. If the mixture seems a bit loose and wet, allow it to simmer a bit more (sometimes we like to partially crush the cubes of beef with the back of a spoon to let them absorb more sauce). Adjust the balance of flavors with a bit of additional salt, sugar, or vinegar, if you like.\n6. Reheat gently and serve in individual bowls with a dollop of sour cream on top and a lime wedge on the side. ",

Allow it to become fragrant, cooking for a further minute or two until the glaze just begins to simmer, then set it aside and let cool to lukewarm (the glaze should be the consistency of room-temperature honey).\nAfter 30 minutes baking time, carefully remove the ham from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 425°F | 220°C.

For added depth of flavour, mix some of the ham pan juices together with the glaze in the pot which will help keep it runny enough for brushing. If your crust is still pink after there suggested baking time, turn on your broiler (or oven grill), and allow it to broil for 2-5 minutes, while keeping an eye on it so it doesn't burn from the sugar. \nLet the ham rest 10-20 minutes before slicing.

Heat the oil to 360-370°F.\n\n3 Mix dry ingredients: While the oil is heating, mix all the dry ingredients together well.\n\n4 Mix sparkling water with egg yolk, then mix with dry ingredients: Once the oil has reached 360°F, take the sparkling water out of the refrigerator and mix it with the egg yolk. Immediately mix it in with the dry ingredients.\n\nMix quickly. Do not worry if there are clumps or lumps. Over-mixing may cause the batter to become chewy when cooked.\n\n5 Sprinkle squid pieces with flour. Use a small sieve to lightly dust the squid pieces with rice flour or regular flour. This will help the batter adhere to the squid.\n\n6 Dip squid pieces in batter and fry in hot oil: Working in small batches at a time (about 6 pieces), dip the squid pieces in the batter. Pick them up one by one and gently put them in the hot oil. (Note if your fingers are coated with the batter, it will help protect them from splatter.)\n\nWhen the squid pieces are in the oil, use a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon to dislodge any squid pieces that may have become stuck from the bottom of the pot or fryer. Fry for 45 seconds to 1 minute, and remove to paper towels to drain.\n\nNote that when done, they will NOT be golden brown, but more of a pale yellow or tan.\n\nRepeat with the rest of the squid. Working in batches will help keep the oil temperature from falling too far while you are frying the squid.\n\n6 Serve immediately: Serve immediately with lime or lemon wedges, soy sauce, ponzu sauce, Tabasco or another hot sauce.\n\nOnce the cooking oil has completely cooled (after about 2 hours), strain it through a paper towel-lined sieve, and save it to reuse the next time you want to deep fry seafood.
