Dip chicken into egg mixture and then into bread crumb mixture; repeat steps for remaining chicken and set aside on a plate.\nIn a deep cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, add 1/4\" oil. When pan is hot but not smoking, add chicken. Cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate to drain.\nMeanwhile, make marinara: In a medium pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and garlic and cook until soft, 4 minutes. Add in tomatoes and water, season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes, and let simmer, 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in parsley.\nPour sauce into a 9-x-13 baking dish and place chicken in sauce. Top with mozzarella and bake until cheese is melty, 10 to 12 minutes. If desired, broil until cheese is golden, 3 minutes.\nGarnish with parsley and serve immediately.",
